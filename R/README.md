#### Folder/file naming conventions

This repository follows the Hadley Wickham [R Style Guide](http://stat405.had.co.nz/r-style.html)

- **Folder** name: A folder name should be meaningful and multiple words are separated by a hyphen. Example: `data-extraction`  
- **File** name: A File names should end in .r and be meaningful and multiple words are separated by hyphen `-`. Example: `explore-diamonds.R`
- **Variable** name: A variable name should be lowercase. Use `_` to separate words within a name. Generally, variable names should be nouns. Example: `butter` `good_butter`.
- **Function** name: A function name should be lowercase. Use `_` to separate words within a name. Generally, function names should be verbs. Example: `calculate_salary()`.
- **Spacing** syntax: Place spaces around all binary operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.). Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a comma. Example: `average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = T)`
- Commenting guidelines
	- Comment your code. Entire commented lines should begin with # and one space. Comments should explain the why, not the what.
	- Use commented lines of - and = to break up your files into scannable chunks.
