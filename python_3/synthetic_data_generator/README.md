## Anonymisation with Synthetic Data

### Introduction

**What is Synthetic data?**, 

Synthetic or Fake data is created by an automated process which contains many of the statistical patterns of an original dataset. It is also sometimes used as a way to release data that has no personal information in it, even if the original did contain data that could identify people. This means programmers and data scientists can continue to build software and algorithms that they know will work similarly on the real data.
