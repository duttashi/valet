## Digital Advertisment (DA)

### Introduction

Digital advertising has become the most important channel for marketers and businesses around the world for a good reason—more and more people are going online to make purchasing decisions.

Today, 40% of the world’s population is connected to the internet, so advertising your brand online delivers the widest reach with the least amount of resources spent.

**So what is DA?**

At its most basic, digital advertising is any form of advertisement that appears online, whether on your web browser, your social media apps, or other destinations and properties across the internet.

DA Terminology

- **Click Through Rate (CTR)**
	- Click-through rate (CTR) prediction models are common in many online applications such as digital advertising and recommender systems. *Field-Aware Factorization Machine* (FFM) and *Field-weighted Factorization Machine* (FwFM) are state-of-the-art among the shallow models for CTR prediction.
	- In a CTR prediction system, the main task is to predict the probability of click on an item shown to a user. Displaying items or advertisements of desired preference to a user not only boosts revenue but also enhances user satisfaction. The CTR data is usually multi-categorical and modeling interaction between features across fields leads to improved CTR prediction performance.
